      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student at UWA doing the coding bootcamp</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from the UK but have lived in Perth for the last 5 years</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Some of my hobbies would be photography, bodyboarding/surfing and hiking</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>It's actually not programming I've always wanted to become a pilot</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I recently just moved down to Halls Head in Mandurah and will probably be moving again in the coming months with my partner :)</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It's another career I've been interested in but never knew where to start as there's so many different avenues you can go down with coding unlike a piloting career.
        But the reason why I want to become a web developer now is because I'm currently in an industry I really do not enjoy (mining) so for me to come out of a well paid career I need
        another one. Luckily for me I came across this which I guess you call it fait, so now here I am begining a new adventure to get me to my end goal in life... that's if I love coding to much and give up my career on being a pilot.
